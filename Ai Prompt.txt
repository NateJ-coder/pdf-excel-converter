Convert the PDFâ€™s Statement of Financial Position into a structured Excel spreadsheet with the following format:

Column A must contain financial line item descriptions (e.g., "Cash and Cash Equivalents", "Trade and Other Receivables")

Columns B onward must represent years (e.g., 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019) as column headers

Each cell under a year must contain the Rand value for that description and year, pulled from the relevant PDF

Descriptions must appear only once and be consistently aligned with the same row across all years

Values must be numeric, cleaned, and formatted in standard float format (e.g., 1234567.89)

Preserve the visual hierarchy using indentation or grouping (not flat repetition)

Do not duplicate descriptions for different years. Use columns for yearly separation, not rows.
